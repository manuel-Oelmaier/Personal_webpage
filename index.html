        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <div class="about-me-content">
            Computer Science student at the Technical University of Munich specializing in Machine Learning and
            AI. Experienced in fine-tuning transformer models and building full-stack applications. Skilled in Python,
            Java, and Bash. Passionate about developing responsible AI solutions and exploring their ethical and
            societal impact.
            In my free time I enjoy playing Chess, reading books and being active in the Gym.

                <h3>Social Responsibility</h3>
                I believe technology should be built with intention and impact in mind.
                As AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, I’m committed to developing systems that are
                safe, transparent, and aligned with human values.
                My work is driven by the idea that engineers have a responsibility to consider not just what we can
                build, but what we should build—and how it affects people and society.
                Books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism"
                              target="_blank">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> remind us that Change is not
                inherently good (nor bad).

                <h3>Development</h3>
                With a strong foundation in computer science, I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable, and
                thoughtful software.
                I enjoy working across the stack—whether it’s crafting clean backend architectures, designing intuitive
                interfaces, or exploring the latest in AI and machine learning.
                As I grow as a developer, I strive to write maintainable, human-friendly code that empowers others and
                leads to meaningful, high-quality products.

            <div class="principle">
                <h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
                Technology changes fast, and staying curious is one of my core principles.
                I continually explore new tools, frameworks, and ideas—whether through building side projects, studying
                academic concepts, or experimenting with emerging technologies like LLMs and deep learning.
                For me, learning isn’t a goal but a habit, and every project is an opportunity to deepen my
                understanding and improve.

                <p>As Coursework, we fine-tuned and compared different small LLMs in their Ability to write Python Code.
                We made the best on publicly available via a <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</abbr> Extension, where the model can be queried locally.
                No more code freely shared to LLMs.</p>
