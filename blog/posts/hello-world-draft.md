# Hello, World! Welcome to my Life Architecture Lab

Welcome to my personal blog. If you’ve found your way here, you’re likely interested in the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and the pursuit of building a more efficient, thoughtful life.

### Why this space exists
As a Computer Science student at TUM and a Software Engineer, I spend most of my day thinking in code and models. But building software is only half the story; the other half is how we use these tools to design our lives. I’m calling this **Life Architecture**.

This blog is where I’ll be documenting:
*   **The Build:** Real-time updates on projects like *ManuChess* (training a mirror of myself in a neural net).
*   **The Theory:** My thoughts on ML/AI, full-stack craftsmanship, and technical strategy.
*   **The Life:** How I balance engineering with books, strategy (Chess), and physical health.

### An Invitation for Feedback
I didn't build this site to be a static resume. I want it to be a **collaborative workspace**. If you read something that sparks an idea, or if you think my latest ML theory is totally wrong—I want to hear it.

Whether it's a technical critique, a book recommendation, or a challenge to a chess match, feel free to reach out.

### What's next?
Stay tuned for a deep dive into how I'm fine-tuning transformer models to replicate my own chess playstyles.

Let’s build something meaningful.
