    Welcome to my personal blog. If you’ve found your way here, you’re likely interested in the intersection of <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, and the pursuit of building a more efficient, thoughtful life.
</p>

<h2>Why this space exists</h2>
<p>
    As a Computer Science student at TUM and a Software Engineer, I spend most of my day thinking in code and models.
    But building software is only half the story; the way more important part is the <em>Why</em>.
    On this blog I aim to share my <em>Why's</em> with you.
    I’m calling this <strong>Life Architecture</strong>.
</p>

<p>This blog is where I’ll be documenting:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Build:</strong> Real-time updates on projects I build and what I learned from them.</li>
    <li><strong>The Theory:</strong> My thoughts on ML/AI, full-stack craftsmanship, and technical strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>The Life:</strong> How I try to be a bit better every day and my thoughts on philosophical questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The "Open Inbox" Policy</h2>
<div class="inbox-policy">
    I didn't build this site to be a static resume. I want it to be a <strong>collaborative workspace</strong>.
    I am always happy to hear a new perspective that I might have missed.
</div>

<p>
    If you read something that sparks an idea, or if you think my latest ML theory is totally wrong—I want to hear it.
    After all, being wrong and changing means you are one step closer to being right!
    Whether it's a technical critique, a book recommendation, or a challenge to a chess match, feel free to reach out.
    I read every email and I promise I will always reply.
</p>

<p>
    Let’s build something meaningful.
