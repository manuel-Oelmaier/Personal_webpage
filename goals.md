# This webpage is there to
- Introduce myself
- spark interest
- showcase projects 

# Important to pay attention to:
- nothing defective e,g
- links work
- viewable on mobile, etc

# TODO:

- Make projects more interactable, aka play chess, query the bot or do the quiz !!!!
- blog

# future ideas:
- finish ManuChess and add!
- navbar if website gets more complex

# Websites as inspiration:
- https://v1.brittanychiang.com/ I quite likes this one ;)
- https://www.oddbird.net/authors/jonny/ background is very nicely done in dark mode here, also like the italic under the name
- https://brittanychiang.com/ is cool but a bit too much, more minimalism would be nice
- https://agustinburgos.com/ is also nice but too much again, but I quite like the GitHub activity graph
