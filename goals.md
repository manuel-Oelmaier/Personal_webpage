# This webpage is there to
- Introduce myself

- showcase projects 

# Important to pay attention to:

- links work
- viewable on mobile, etc

# TODO:
- 3rd Project added (Project showcase in general)
- Hero image optimization
- text too AI ?
- link color 
- uploading website ;)
- blog
- Search engine optimization, e.g correct meta tags,compressed everything,..
- fast loading times
- Analytics -> Plausible open source
- navigation with keyboard ?
# future ideas:
- Github activity embedded, (not enough activity to look good)
- navbar if website gets more complex

# Websites as inspiration:
- https://v1.brittanychiang.com/ I quite likes this one ;)
- https://www.oddbird.net/authors/jonny/ background is very nicely done in dark mode here, also like the italic under the name
- https://brittanychiang.com/ is cool but a bit too much, more minimalism would be nice
- https://agustinburgos.com/ is also nice but too much again, but i quite like the github activity graph
