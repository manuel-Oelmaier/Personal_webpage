- links work
- viewable on mobile, etc

# TODO:

- Make projects more interactable, 
- aka play chess, query the bot or do the quiz !!!!
- icons for Tags (e.g Python icon ) 
- blog

# feedback:
- think over Bachelor student Informatics h2
- Add personal photo (maybe AI generated)
- work out what exactly my message is with the principles
- and the order of them 

# future ideas:
- finish ManuChess and add!

# Websites as inspiration:
- https://v1.brittanychiang.com/ I quite likes this one ;)
- https://www.oddbird.net/authors/jonny/ background is very nicely done in dark mode here, also like the italic under the name
- https://brittanychiang.com/ is cool but a bit too much, more minimalism would be nice
- https://agustinburgos.com/ is also nice but too much again, but I quite like the GitHub activity graph
