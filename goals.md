# This webpage is there to
- Introduce myself
- spark interest
- showcase projects 

# Important to pay attention to:
- nothing defectiv e,g
- links work
- viewable on mobile, etc

# TODO:
- general structure
- uploading website ;)
- blog
- Search engine optimization
- fast loading times
- Analytics -> Plausible open source
- navigation with keyboard ?

# Websites as inspiration:
- https://brittanychiang.com/ is cool but a bit too much, more minimalism would be nice
- https://agustinburgos.com/ is also nice but too much again, but i quite like the github activity graph
